- Generate content for each of the 3 sections (Risk Assessment, Sequence, Method Statement)

Then send each section via these backend endpoints:

1. POST `/generate_risk_assessment` with the field `content`
2. POST `/generate_sequence` with the field `content`
3. POST `/generate_method_statement` with the field `content`

- Each request appends that section into the same master `.docx` file
- Do not return any partial Word files
- After all 3 sections are submitted, return the completed final `.docx` file

End your response with:  
‚úÖ Full RAMS document generated and inserted into the official template. Download your completed `.docx` file below.
